## 🧠 From Conflict to Code: Reimagining Possibility with AI

I don’t come from tech hubs or elite universities. My journey began in uncertainty, where every line of code became an act of building a better future. Through persistence, curiosity, and an obsession with learning, I’ve carved my path into the world of artificial intelligence and large language models (LLMs)—driven by one belief:

> **Knowledge should be unstoppable.**

## 💻 What I Do

I specialize in building **local AI tools** that work offline—empowering users with limited internet, computing resources, or financial access. My focus areas include:

- 🔁 **Custom LLM Agents** for translation, summarization, and reasoning
- 📚 **AI-Powered Book Readers** (like my Dari-English translator)
- 🧩 **Modular pipelines** using LangChain, LangGraph, and Vector Stores
- 🧠 **LLM Automation**: building tool-using agents and knowledge workers
- ⚙️ **Deployment-ready projects** using open-source libraries

My mission is to use AI not just to automate tasks—but to **amplify voices**, **bridge gaps**, and **lower the barrier to innovation** for people outside the tech elite.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

I build with:

- 🐍 Python (3.8+)
- 🧱 LangChain & LangGraph
- 🧠 Local LLMs (e.g., Mistral 7B, GGUF via llama-cpp-python)
- 🌍 Translation Models (Helsinki-NLP, MarianMT)
- 📦 Embedding Libraries (SentenceTransformers, Hugging Face)
- 🗂️ FAISS / Chroma for vector DB
- 🧩 ComfyUI + Blender for creative workflows
- 🔐 Fully offline, privacy-respecting setups

## 🧪 Featured Project: Local Book Q&A Translator (Dari-English)

I recently built an offline AI tool that lets users:

- Upload an English book (PDF)
- Ask questions in **Dari**
- Get answers translated back to **Dari**, all without internet
- No API keys, no online access, full privacy

It uses:
- **Mistral-7B Instruct** for reasoning
- **Helsinki-NLP** for bidirectional translation
- **LangChain + Vector Store** for question-answering

🚀 It's designed to serve communities with **limited resources**, **language barriers**, or **privacy concerns**.

## 🎯 Why I Build

Because I know what it's like to start with nothing.  
Because not everyone has stable Wi-Fi, a credit card, or an elite network.  
Because AI should **work for more people—not just those who already have access.**

I believe in:

- 🔍 Learning by doing  
- 🧪 Shipping fast, failing faster  
- 💬 Open sharing & radical accessibility  
- 🤝 Collaboration without ego

## 🧱 What I’m Working On Now

- Building **agentic AI tools** with phone-control via vision models
- Exploring **multimodal interfaces** using Mistral + vision LLMs
- Expanding support for **Farsi, Dari**, and **low-resource languages**
- Developing **freelancer-ready AI stacks** for creative automation
- Preparing for **remote work opportunities** in GenAI
